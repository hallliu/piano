piano
=====

A short and simple piano written in Java. Can use mouse and ASDF keys to play notes (use number keys to change octave).
Also plays songs written in a specific format. Examples are in the examples directory.

Requires JNA, Java GTK bindings, and FluidSynth. Additionally, a sound font file is required. Grab one from somewhere
and save it as sound.sf2 in the directory of the binary.

Not sure how to compile this yet. Will update 01/07
